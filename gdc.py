            1. Is the goal related to organizing or learning something?

            4. Does the goal require external dependencies that would make it unachievable?

                You are tasked with generating a comprehensive and structured description of a user's goal. Use the information provided below to create a detailed narrative that reflects all aspects of the user's needs and preferences.

                User Information:
                - **User Goal:** {message}
                - **Preferred Learning Style:** {preferences["learningStyle"]}

                - **Additional Notes:** {preferences["additionalNotes"]}

                Instructions:
                1. Analyze each piece of information and explain how it influences the overall goal.
                2. Organize your description into clear sections (e.g., Overview, Detailed Explanation, and Implications).
                3. Emphasize any interconnections between the user's learning style, preferred complexity, motivational level, and prior experience.
                4. Ensure the narrative is detailed, coherent, and tailored to the userâ€™s specific context.

                You are tasked with generating a series of smaller, achievable subtasks to help a user organize their learning process based on the high-level task provided below.

                - {refined_goal_description}

                Instructions:
                1. Decompose the high-level task into a logical sequence of subtasks.
                2. For each subtask, provide:
                - **name_of_the_task:** A clear, descriptive title for the subtask.
                - **description:** A detailed explanation of what needs to be done, including practical examples and tips.
                3. Ensure that:
                - The subtasks follow a logical order.
                - Each subtask is clearly defined.
                - Time estimates are realistic for a student with {preferences["priorExperience"]} prior experience in the topic.
                - If a task is too time-consuming, split it into smaller, manageable subtasks.
